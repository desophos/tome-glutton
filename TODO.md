- More generics



from Hellcommander:

- give Famish the ability to grant some of the resources that are drained by the skill
- increase the range of Salivate a little
- make it so that Whet appetite works on sustains and maybe have grant you some resources (maybe just heal some health) maybe for each buff consumed

Consume Artifact:
- For devouring a arcane artifacts could you grant it the ability to grant you a permanent 0.02x tier level mana regen that caps at 1 or maybe 2 a turn for this type.
- For devouring a technique artifacts could you grant it the ability to grant you a permanent 0.01x tier level stamina regen that caps at 0.5 or maybe 1 a turn from this type.
- For devouring a psionic artifacts could you grant it the ability to grant you a permanent 0.01x tier level Psi regen that caps at 0.25 or maybe 0.5 a turn from this type.
- Maybe remove all the power increases from consuming these items or maybe limit the max it can increase your power to something like 10.



from Zonk:

Would be nice if the stats from Catabolize were based on the highest stats the monster had - would take some extra form but it seems thematic to me.

- More generics
- Make Hunger life regen compatible with other addons (?)



from Hellcommander:

- give Famish the ability to grant some of the resources that are drained by the skill
- increase the range of Salivate a little
- make it so that Whet appetite works on sustains and maybe have grant you some resources (maybe just heal some health) maybe for each buff consumed

Generics:
- Generic that increases cap for absorbed class abilities (1.2 per raw level). (can't take points out for balance)
- Generic that improves cap for generic absorbed talents (maybe one per raw level)(can't take points out for balance)
- Generic that reduces rate that you get hungry? (.02 less per raw level?).
- Generic that gives you buff when you devour mobs? (maybe grant 1% per raw level of mobs resources that was devoured implement resource gain here instead for the resources that you share).

Consume Artifact:
- For devouring a arcane artifacts could you grant it the ability to grant you a permanent 0.02x tier level mana regen that caps at 1 or maybe 2 a turn for this type.
- For devouring a technique artifacts could you grant it the ability to grant you a permanent 0.01x tier level stamina regen that caps at 0.5 or maybe 1 a turn from this type.
- For devouring a psionic artifacts could you grant it the ability to grant you a permanent 0.01x tier level Psi regen that caps at 0.25 or maybe 0.5 a turn from this type.
- Maybe remove all the power increases from consuming these items or maybe limit the max it can increase your power to something like 10.



from Zonk:

Would be nice if the stats from Catabolize were based on the highest stats the monster had - would take some extra form but it seems thematic to me.

Could have a tree that boosts things not directly related to eating but which still fit with the concept. 
For example, if you can eat EVERYTHING, then maybe a poison+disease resistance talent would be fitting.
